This is my ##Laravel Project - MVC of PHP
Basically its a blog which supports the CRUD operations of a restful architecture.
Supports adding users, creating blogs, reading blogs, updating and deleting blogs.

Session is handled gracefully.
Used Eloquent Models to avoid SQL injection.
Used Ajax to validate all the forms.
